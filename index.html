                <p>
                    The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built in 1991 and began hosting the Spanish 
                    Grand Prix that same year. Construction also coincided with the Olympic Games scheduled 
                    to take place in Barcelona the next year, where the circuit acted as the start and 
                    finish line for the road team time trial cycling event.

                <h4>2022 Cars on Track</h4>
                <p>
                    The 2022 regulations, originally slated to arrive in 2021 but delayed by Covid-19, 
                    had one guiding principle: to allow closer racing with the potential for more 
                    overtakes a happy, but secondary, benefit.

                <h4>Safety Car Rules</h4>
                <p>
                    Once the message is displayed, lapped cars are able to overtake and the Safety Car 
                    will return to the pits. This has been done with the aim of reducing the amount of 
                    time it will take for backmarkers to pass the leaders, or allow the teams more notice 
                    of racing to be resumed.

                <p>Brand new cars have been an area of major focus for the teams over the

        <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing 
            for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale 
            de l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One 
            World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world 
            since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules 
            to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, 
            known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
        </p><br><p>
            A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: 
            one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, 
            the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA. The races must run on tracks 
            graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.
        </p><br><p>
            Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, 
            owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts 
            of aerodynamic downforce. The cars underwent major changes in 2017, allowing wider 
            front and rear wings, and wider tyres, resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 
            lateral g and top speeds of around 350 km/h (215 mph). As of 2021, the hybrid 
            engines are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm; the cars are dependent 
            on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. Traction control, launch control, 
            and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. 
            They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 
            and 2008 respectively.
        </p><br><p>
            With the average annual cost of running a team – designing, building, and maintaining cars, 
            pay, transport – being approximately US$247 million,[7] its financial and political battles 
            are widely reported. On 23 January 2017, Liberty Media completed the acquisition of the Formula 
            One Group, from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for $8 billion.
